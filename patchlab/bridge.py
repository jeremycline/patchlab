API to retrieve completed patch series, applies them to a git repository with

    Convert a Patchwork series into a pull request in GitLab.

    The series is converted by:

    1. Checking out the latest version of the configured development branch
       from GitLab.
    2. Checking out a new branch for the series using "email/series-<id>" as
       the branch naming scheme.
    3. Using "git-am" to apply the series to the new branch.
    4. Opening a merge request using git push options with GitLab.

    Pull requests opened with the function are tagged with ``From email``.

        series: A dictionary representing a series as retrieved from
            the patchwork API.
