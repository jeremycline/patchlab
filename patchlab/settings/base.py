Django settings specific to Patchlab.

Patchlab is intended to be run as an extension to Patchwork, so you should
start with a valid `patchwork configuration`_ and include the settings
documented here in that file.

.. note:: Don't forget to add Patchlab to the INSTALLED_APPS list. If you're
    using the production.example.py settings file provided by Patchwork as
    the starting point, adding ``INSTALLED_APPS.append("patchlab")`` to the
    end of the file is enough.

Patchlab uses Django's builtin email framework so be sure include email related
`Django settings`_.
