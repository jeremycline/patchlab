Welcome to the patchlab development environment!

Here are some tips:

* The code is located at ~/patchlab and ~/patchwork

* Start and stop the development server with
  `systemctl --user {action} patchwork.service`

* All logs are viewable through `journalctl`

* You can type `workon pw` to enter a configured Python virtualenv

Once you start the development server, you can navigate to http://localhost:8000/
in your host's browser.

Happy hacking!
